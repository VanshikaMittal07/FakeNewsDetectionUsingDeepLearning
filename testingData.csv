3,Supercomputer to forecast monsoon with dynamical model,"Next year, India’s annual summer monsoon forecast may be made by a supercomputer running a dynamical model.The Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Madhavan Rajeevan, said the dynamical model, being tested at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, (IITM) Pune for a decade was “ready for operational purposes next year.” A dynamical monsoon model works by simulating the weather on powerful computers and extrapolating it over particular timeframes.Though this method is normally effective in forecasting weather over a few days, using it to forecast the annual monsoon over 3 or 4 months has proved difficult.While such models have been used for research purposes for long, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has never integrated them into its operational forecast. “We hope to be able to launch it next year though discussions are still ongoing,” Mr. Rajeevan said, on the sidelines of an Earth Sciences Ministry foundation day event on Wednesday. The IMD, a division of MoES, is the official national weather forecaster. Mr. Rajeevan clarified that statistical models would still be in use next year. The IMD Director-General, L.S. Rathore, said, “We are ready to use the dynamical model, but this doesn’t mean one is abandoned for the other. Both have their role and we must use what’s best.”The IMD relies on an ensemble model, a statistical technique that uses an average of six meteorological values correlated to the monsoon such as sea surface temperatures in the Pacific, and North Atlantic sea level pressure. These values are derived from century-old meteorological data linked to the historical performance of the monsoon.Prediction failuresThis traditional approach in recent decades has failed to predict monsoon failures — in 2002 and 2004 for instance — leading to calls by meteorologists for a new, modern forecasting system.Though the dynamical model, called the Coupled Forecast System version 2, has so far achieved only 60 per cent accuracy in forecasting the monsoon, Mr. Rajeevan says it is good enough for now. “No doubt it needs to improve and the aim is to make that 77 per cent but we have to start somewhere,” he added. A confidence boost came when the dynamical model and the ensemble technique correctly signalled a drought in 2015.While the IMD has for some years put out the dynamical model’s forecast along with the traditional one, its plans to give prominence to the dynamical model signals a new approach. This is a precursor to giving monsoon predictions over India’s 36 sub-divisions rather than only four broad geographic regions that encompass them. A dynamical approach can also be more easily tuned to account for rapidly changing global weather conditions.",2016,9,1
4,"REVEALED: Underground group of non-BJP politicians, sympathizers play BINGO before every election","An intrepid The UnReal Times investigation has brought to light something astounding. There exists an underground group of non-BJP politicians, sympathizers, media persons, intellectuals and sundry other anti Right Wing personalities who play a customized version of the popular game BINGO before every assembly or general election in India.Our reporter managed to click a photo of a half-filled BINGO grid of one of the players from an ongoing game. We reproduce it here:As per the rules of the game, each player carries with him or her a grid like this where the same elements are distributed in random fashion. After a designated launch date, the players start ticking off incidents referred to in the grid’s cells as and when they happen. The first person to strike off four elements in a row – horizontally, vertically or diagonally – wins the game.“I only need two more incidents to get BINGO. Fingers crossed!” said an excited Samajwadi Party leader who is part of this underground group of players.According to sources, the game was originally conceived by a bunch of bored Congress leaders in the late nineties, who played the game to amuse themselves. Later, as 24×7 news channels came into prominence, interest in the game grew and the pool of players expanded to include regional anti-BJP parties, prominent intellectuals and some media persons.A game is typically launched a few months before an election. If it is a big one, such as the General elections or the assembly election of an important state such as UP, the game may be launched more than an year in advance. A computer program picks elements from a pool of incidents, prints randomized grids and randomly assigns it to participants. Players exchange whispered updates on their BINGO grids during inter-party meets, weddings, news debates and various other occasions.Congress leader Ahmed Patel is said to be the reigning BINGO champion, and has won as many as seven BINGO titles. “It is crazy how often he wins. It’s uncanny. Events happen according to their positions in his BINGO grid. It’s almost as if he had something to do with it,” said another BINGO player, shaking his head in awe.",2016,9,0
5,None,"Allegation of rape against bishop A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday asked the State government to inform the court about the progress of the investigation into the allegation of rape levelled by a nun against Jalandhar bishop Franco Mulakkal.The Bench comprising Chief Justice Hrishikesh Roy and Justice A.K.Jayasankaran Nambiar passed the order while hearing two public interest litigations filed by the Kerala Catholic Church Reformation Movement, Pala, and George Vattukkulam from Thrissur seeking a directive to arrest the bishop and to conduct a time-bound investigation.The court orally observed that nobody was above law and no one should have any misconception about it.The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the police had filed a report in the High Court earlier saying the evidence collected so far revealed that the accused bishop committed an unnatural offence and committed rape repeatedly on different dates on the victim.Despite the evidence, no steps had been taken to arrest the bishop, the counsel argued. The delay in the arrest had given an opportunity for the accused to intimidate the witnesses.The counsel pointed out that while disposing of a petition filed by the Catholic Reform Movement earlier seeking arrest, a single judge had observed that it was within the discretion of the investigation officer to take a call on the arrest of the bishop after interrogating him. It was also submitted that notwithstanding the lodging of a complaint with the Kuravilangad police station by one of the nuns who had deposed before the investigation officer that there was threat to her life as well as the lives of other witnesses, no case had been registered by the police till date and no protection had been given to them.The government pleader then sought two days time to get instructions from the police and report on the progress of the investigation.",2018,9,1
6,"Kids land up outside Hema Malini's house for Halloween, get a demo of Kent RO instead of candies","‘Trick or Treat’ screamed the bunch of kids who excitedly gathered outside Hema Malini’s house hoping to get their share of candies on Halloween.But sadly for them it did not quite turn out as expected. The Bollywood actress gave the kids a demo of Kent water purifier instead.Apparently the actress was adamant and turned a deaf ear to the persistent requests of the kids for chocolates. “Kids should be kept away from chocolates and candies. There cannot be a better treat than a demo of Kent water purifier. Kent deta hai sabse shudh paani,” she said while explaining the features of the latest model to our reporter.The incident has divided Bollywood with many agreeing with the actress. Karan Johar however had a different view and thought Hemaji was taking her brand endorsement a bit too far. “The kids at her doorstep were not ordinary kids. They are star kids and the default passengers of my Bollywood launch vehicle. I think they deserve better treatment,” he said.",2017,10,0
7,Digital photography moves up a level,"This Android app creates interactive photos that move as you tilt and rotate the phone in your handFyuse is somewhere between a video, a photo, and a GIF. It is an iOS and Android app that creates interactive photos that move as you tilt and rotate the phone in your hand.You can control how fast the photo moves by turning your hand, the resulting effect is more immersive than a photo, but very different from a video or a GIF. The makers have called this “spatial photography”. The whole effect is worth checking out.The presence of giants like Instagram and Vine can make it difficult for newcomers like Fyuse to gain enough traction. The community of Fyuse is a lot smaller than Instagram’s, but the app provides us with a fresh approach to shooting and sharing what is around us.When you create a new Fyuse, all you have to think is, “point, shoot, tilt”. You will have to fire up the camera in the app, point it at whatever you want to click, press and hold the screen, and start tilting or moving your phone in one direction.When you begin recording, the app shows arrows to guide you.It is possible to record up to 360 degrees in one direction. When you reach the limit, the app automatically stops recording. You can also stop capturing by lifting your finger.You will be able to shoot in only one direction with each Fyuse – either horizontally or vertically. Irrespective of how you move the phone, you can shoot in either the landscape mode or the portrait mode.Each Fysue has a spot in which comments can be left. You can “echo” it, which shares it with your followers, not unlike a retweet on Twitter. The app also has option to share it on Facebook, Twitter, in a text, via email, or by simply copying the direct link. If the Fyuse is yours, you can edit or delete it.",2016,3,1
8,Nun’s sister joins hunger strike," The sister of the nun who has accused Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal of raping her repeatedly joined the hunger strike and public protest in Kochi on Monday demanding the bishop’s arrest.She came to the venue of the protest at Kerala High Court Junction at 11 a. m. She was garlanded before she briefly addressed the audience and joined the hunger strike on the podium. Later in the afternoon, writer and social activist P. Geetha joined the hunger strike in support of the demand.The sister of the nun said she expected the courts of law to deliver justice even though the government appeared to have failed them.Sister Jesme, writer and a former Catholic nun who left her religious order, was among the speakers on Monday, the 10th day of the public protest being spearheaded by the Save Our Sisters Action Council. The action council comprises various Church reform-minded lay and religious organisations.Sister Jesme said the nuns who launched the public protest had made history. She compared it to the “me too” campaign against abuses and they were making history now. She appealed to them not to go back but to fight for justice with courage and grace. She said she was called a mad woman, she was described as a “fallen angel” and “Judas” for her campaign against the injustices within the Church. She said evil would have only temporary victory and ultimately the good and just would win.Meanwhile, the public protest by the nuns demanding the bishop’s arrest has gone from strength to strength with the organisers claiming that around a hundred organisations had come out in support and solidarity with them. Students from the Government Law College were among those who spoke at the venue, offering legal support. Members of the Sree Narayana Sahodara Dharmavedhi too marched in support of the protesters. P.V. Shaji from Kottappuram expressed solidarity with the protesters by running backward from Menaka Junction to the venue of the protest action on Monday.",2018,9,1

10,Bolangir to Bengaluru: Drought drives people to bonded labour,"43 labourers and children were rescued from a brick kiln in Bagalur on ThursdayFor more than half a century, Krushna had not seen the world outside of Bolangir district in Odisha where he grows rice on a small piece of land. Some time last year, the rain failed completely in his region, and he was forced to look for work elsewhere.A man in the area offered him, and others suffering from similar agrarian distress, a job in Bengaluru. The lure came in the form of a loan of ₹20,000. “I came here in November thinking I would work till the end of the summer...But, some time in February, I didn’t even think I would survive till then,” he says.Tales of woeKrushna is among 43 labourers and children rescued from a brick kiln in Bagalur on Thursday, where they were trafficked to work as bonded labourers. The group would work nearly 16 hours a day.The children would flip over bricks during the baking process. If every couple achieved 6,000 bricks by the end of the week, they would be given ₹300 each — or, one-sixth of the mandated daily-wage rate in the State. Children were made to flip the bricks in the baking oven. “I thought if I work, I can send some money to my wife and two children (who are in his native village). I haven’t been able to save a single rupee,” says Krushna.If distress in Odisha has seen labourers being forced into feudal servitude each year, the brick kilns on the outskirts of the city — catering to the burgeoning demand from the real estate sector — continue to see exploitation of cheap labour. According to the group, which left for Odisha on Saturday morning, their relatives and neighbours are spread across at least 12 kilns in the region — all of them working in similar conditions.International Justice Mission, which assisted the district administration and the local police in the rescue, said more than half of the bonded labourers rescued are from Odisha, and in particular Bolangir district. Of the 1,141 persons rescued, 623 were from Odisha; while in 2017, 155 of 273 workers were from Odisha.Among those rescued was 20-year-old Mithali, who is six months pregnant. While her husband and brother-in-law pleaded with the owner to let her go back to their hometown, she said he would ‘give her a tablet’ and force her to continue. “It was very hard work. Even if I felt sick and would be vomiting, I would be forced to make bricks,” she said.But, for the rescued persons, there is fear of going back home. The traffickers and their networks continue to remain strong in their home district. Some narrate stories of their relatives, who had fled brick kilns, being threatened and assaulted. They were either forced to go back to bonded labour or pay up the loan amount.“Where do we go now? What protection will we get from the traffickers that brought us here?” said a diminutive woman in the group.No compensationWhile the 2017 Central Government Scheme, which enhances the on-the-spot compensation to ₹20,000 for those rescued, none of the rescued in this case or previous cases in Bengaluru have received the money.“We have written to the Centre for clarity on how to give the money, under which head (of accounts) should it be taken, and whether it should be given in cash or cheque,” said M.K. Jagadeesh, Assistant Commissioner of Bengaluru Urban. “But, the compensation amount can be claimed from their home districts and we will provide certificates that say that these labourers have not been paid compensation,” he added.(Names of the people rescued have been changed to protect their identities)",2018,3,1
11,Gokarna temple: SC for status quo ,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed status quo in the management of the Gokarna Mahabaleshwara Temple at Gokarna in Uttara Kannada district.A Bench of Justices Kurian Joseph and A.M. Khanwilkar said the apex court’s September 7 direction refusing to stay a Karnataka High Court direction for the appointment of an overseeing committee to manage the temple would continue.The High Court had on August 10 quashed a 2008 government order handing over the management of the temple to Sree Ramachandrapura Mutt, Hosanagar.The court constituted the overseeing committee, to be headed by the Uttara Kannada Deputy Commissioner, to monitor the daily affairs of the Mahabaleshwara and allied temples, and appointed B.N.

12,Many actors bribed the organizers to remove their name from nomination list of IIFA awards: Report,"The 18th edition of the International Indian Film Academy awards ended on a high with Udta Punjab winning four awards on Saturday night. Over 40,000 people cheered for their favorite Bollywood stars as they walked the IIFA Green Carpet ahead of the awards ceremony at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. But the fans will be shocked to know that many leading actors had bribed the organizers for removing their names from the nomination list. This is according to a investigating report by Mumbai Police.Mumbai police had got a tip off that most actors don’t value or rate IIFA too highly and it would have been a shame for them to be nominated in any of the categories, so they bribed the organizers very heavily to get their names removed. The list includes many A-listers like Rakshay Kumar, Rithwik Roshan, Mayur Khan and many more. Actually IIFA has always been looked upon as time pass awards by many stars. Only the ones performing there are the ones who feel IIFA is real good. Some actors like Rukshaar Kapoor, Farheem Khan had also tried to bribe the organizers, but they realized later that like all other awards, they were not nominated here too.Faking News reporter caught up with the organizing manager Jagdish Malik and he had this to say,” It is a complete lie. We at IIFA don’t accept bribe. What we accept is bribe in form of performance. Take it from me, if any actor has not performed here it means he/she has not bribed us. This is a rumor spread by rival award functions like FILMnotFAIR awards, StarDustParticle awards and many more. Wait for the complete investigation to come out and you will see the truth for yourself. Till then don’t call us cheats, for we are the torch bearers of promoting Indian films at the world stage.”",2017,7,0
13,"Rajinikanth loots dollars from US Central Bank, oil from Arabia to save the Indian economy","With the Indian economy staring into the abyss, Superstar Rajinikanth has decided to take matters into his own hands to save billions of Indians from impending economic distress. In a real life operation conducted over land and under sea, he first dug a tunnel from Oman to the Eccles Building in Washington D.C., home to the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, and stole half-a-trillion dollars ($500,000,000,000) in cash. He then dove into the Arabian Sea and laid an under-water pipeline to extract oil from Saudi Arabia and transport it to the Indian west coast. This daring heist bears uncanny resemblance to his celluloid capers: he had similarly resuscitated the Indian economy by looting black money from the coffers of venal politicians, bureaucrats and industrialists in his yesteryear hit movie, Shivaji.This sudden disappearance of liquidity from the US economy means that US Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, will have to scuttle his plans to taper off the QE programme that had triggered a sharp rise in long-term interest rates in the US, thereby inducing investors to pull their investments out of the Indian economy, causing the rupee to slide precipitously. The rupee is set to rise again as FIIs, heartened by Rajini’s intervention, pump hot money back into the Indian capital markets.However, Rajinikanth would not be Rajinikanth if he merely believed in short-term measures. He has decided to tackle the structural issues bedeviling the Indian economy head-on. First, he plans to invest 20 billion of the stolen dollars through Baba Hedge Funds into the Indian stock markets. This sudden inflow will assuage the sentiments of the foreign investors who were getting cagey about India’s slowing economy. Consequently, the markets are expected to pick up after the latest blood bath caused by the passage of SoniaG’s dreams the Food Security Bill.He will then pump over a hundred billion dollars via FDI into the defence sector to build robots like those in his movie Robot. Other defence plans include developing Muthu missiles – nuclear capable MIRV ICBMs with a range of 8000 km – and Baasha Anti-Missile Defence System that will seek and destroy enemy missiles in the outer space.He plans to open a Shivaji Bank that will offer interest-free loans to the poor. This will stimulate investment activity, which has been hitherto sluggish, owing to high interest rates under a hawkish RBI. He also plans to take care of the three villains of the economy, namely inflation, the current account deficit (CAD) and unsustainable subsidies, with a single bullet:  stolen oil from the Middle East. Sweet crude piped from Saudi oil fields via an under-sea pipeline will help wipe out the CAD and allow the Indian government to supply petrol and diesel to the aam aadmi free-of-cost without burdening the exchequer.For the long-term benefit of the economy, he also used some money to grease the palms of some politicians and bureaucrats to hasten the regulatory and environmental clearances for infrastructure investments worth seven lakh crore that have been in limbo due to red tape. All these moves are expected to put the economy back on a double-digit growth path regardless of Rajiv Gandhi’s dreams, Sonia Gandhi’s whims, and Rahul Gandhi’s deeply philosophical musings.At the time of press, latest information from our sources indicates that Rajinikanth is planning a major heist of chicken from China to tackle the high food inflation caused by higher demand for protein products.",2013,8,0
14,Chain snatchers on the prowl,"Involvement of students sets alarm bells ringingBe alert when you come on to the road. Observe the people moving around you. Chain-snatchers are on the prowl and may attack you any time.Snatchers are targeting women travelling on bikes and pedestrians in isolated places and cases have been reported in Guntur, East and West Godavari, Prakasam, Nellore and other districts. However, police say that there is a decline in chain-snatching incidents when compared with the last few years.Intensified police patrolling, monitoring Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System (CCTNS), installation of Closed Circuit Televisions (CCTNs) and using advanced technology for prevention and detection of snatching cases have reduced the number of cases, the police said.Students heldInvolvement of graduate, postgraduate, professional college students and even some minors in chain-snatching incidents have shocked the police. There is a rise in students getting arrested in such cases.Some students allegedly addicted to vices are resorting to chain-snatching for easy money. After the crime, the accused are mortgaging the booty with a pawnbroker or with a mortgage firm to get cash and are leading a lavish life.“We request parents to keep a watch on the movements of their wards. Students who are addicted to alcohol, smoking and leading a lavish lifestyle, are resorting to crimes and are ruining their careers,” an investigation officer said.If this is so, some offenders are taking to chain-snatching as their livelihood. The accused are committing offences alone and some are forming gangs and sharing the booty.“Offenders are striking at a couple of places in either Andhra Pradesh or Telangana and escaping to remote places. After exchanging the valuables for cash, they are maintaining their families. Not only chain-snatching, in the process the accused are lifting bikes and resorting to burglaries and thefts if the police vigil is not high on roads,” a senior police officer observed.Some pawnbrokers and mortgage companies are offering cash for the jewellery whatever they deposit with them and are perpetrating the crime. The police say private money lenders and gold mortgaging firms are not following procedures while giving loans for jewellery deposited.Taking this as an advantage, chain-snatchers are crediting booty with private money lenders and finance companies.“Persons or the companies involved in accepting jewellery for mortgage and money lending businesses should insist on the identity of the customer, collect residential address, Aadhaar and phone number, guarantor and take their thumb impression. If a person is repeatedly visiting the pawnbroker they should alert the police, failing which the receiver can be booked as per law,” a Central Crime Station officer said.Speaking to The Hindu, Vijayawada Police Commissioner D. Gautam Sawang said the police are planning to install more CCTVs at major junctions in the city to prevent chain-snatching incidents. At present, 700 surveillance cameras are installed in the city, he said.“By identifying the places through Global Positioning System (GPS), we installed CCTVs, which are giving good results. Proposals have been sent for arranging more cameras at about 2,000 more points,” the Police Commissioner explained.The police are planning to organise meetings in educational institutions and explain to the students the consequences if involved in criminal cases. Meeting are also proposed with pawnbrokers and private finance firms.“We will step up intelligence at colleges to identify students moving with anti-social elements. We request the parents to keep a watch on their children and friends,” Mr. Sawang said.Modus Operandi ( to go as box) The modus operandi of the offenders include visiting different places to conduct ‘recce’, identify the isolated places, roads and lanes and target women walking or even those on bikes. After committing the offence, the accused escape to neighbouring districts or neighbouring State.The accused will not come back to the place where he resorted to the snatching for a few months, but will continue committing offences in other places. In many cases, the offenders arrested in one case were wanted in many cases registered in different police stations, according to a police officer. ",2017,9,1

It is aimed at identifying the extent to which world leaders use the site and how they connect on the social network.Since his election in May 2014, Modi’s account has moved into the top three most followed Twitter accounts of world leaders, said Twiplomacy’s Matthias Luefkens. He told IANS that Modi was also among the most effective in terms of re-tweets per tweet.Modi’s huge victory in the 2014 general election was partly credited to a well-organised social media campaign. Among the foreign ministries, the US State Department (@StateDept) is the most followed with 1,7 million followers ahead of the Turkish (@TC_Disisleri), the Russian (@MID_RF) and the French (@FranceDiplo) all with less than a million followers.The study said it was impossible to say whether governments pay to promote the accounts of their leaders. But “we have seen an interesting pattern on @IndianDiplomacy (official account of India’s public diplomacy) and @MEAIndia (India’s ministry of external affairs) accounts whose tweets are automatically re-tweeted by an army of 90 tweeps who all follow each other and whose sole purpose is to re-tweet the tweets from @IndianDiplomacy and @MEAIndia, the accounts listed on each of their public Twitter list, aptly entitled ‘RT’,” the study said.The study also showed Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame as the most conversational world leader with 86 percent of his tweets being @replies to other Twitter users followed by Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg. Conducted by global communications firm Burson—Marsteller, the report studied 669 Twitter accounts of heads of state and government, foreign ministers and their institutions in 166 countries worldwide.",2016,9,1

17,Union Minister’s promise to Kotia villagers ,"Both Andhra Pradesh and Odisha claim jurisdiction over 21 villages The inter-State dispute over the jurisdiction of 21 of the 28 Kotia group of villages on the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border took a new twist on Monday with Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan visiting the region and promising the tribal residents justice.Mr. Pradhan told the villagers living in the hilltop areas that he would hold a discussion with the Odisha Government to iron out the differences with Andhra Pradesh. On arrival, he was given certain documents by former Koraput Collector and convener of Amo Kotia Sanghathan Gadadhar Parida to substantiate the claim of Odisha.Before leaving for Kotia from Visakhapatnam, Mr. Pradhan told The Hindu that based on genuine claims, the controversy surrounding the villages would be sorted out.Identity crisisIn all, 5,500 tribal people living in the villages are facing an identity crisis with both Odisha and Andhra Pradesh claiming jurisdiction over them since 1956 and vying with one another to extend various benefits. The villages are located about 30-km from Narayanpatna, which is a hotbed for the Left Wing Extremists.One can reach the villages from Neredavalasa in Sarakka panchayat of Andhra Pradesh or Sunki of Odisha. The villages are shown as part of the Salur Assembly segment and Araku Parliamentary Constituency by Andhra Pradesh and Pottangi Assembly segment and Koraput Parliamentary Constituency by Odisha.Two sarpanches Interestingly, the villages have two sarpanches. Biswanath Khila represents Odisha and Bisu Gemel is the elected sarpanch from Kotia representing Andhra Pradesh.Mr. Parida said, in the maps prepared in 1945, the Kotia gram panchayat had been shown as part of Odisha and the claim of Andhra Pradesh was not genuine. Odisha BJP leader Jayaram Pangi said both the Centre and Odisha should take action to resolve the impasse.",2018,4,1
18,Customs officials bust drug racket,"Seize 12 kg of methaqualone at international airport Customs officials at Kempegowda International Airport seized 12.9 kg of the banned drug methaqualone on Wednesday. Its value in the international market is around Rs. 6.45 crore. According to Customs officials, the consignment was to be shipped to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia by an export firm based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The goods were declared as 'palm sugar' for personal use, with a declared value of Rs. 6,000. Methaqualone is a sedative and hypnotic medication. Officials believe that the consignment is part of an international drug racket. Drugs concealed in packets of palm sugarThe drugs were packed in plastic packets, which were inserted in larger packets of palm sugar. Officials of the Courier Section of Air Cargo detected the drugs while assessing the consignment. Acting on a hunch that something was not quite right with the consignment, they opened a few packets and found smaller pouches within filled with a white crystalline powder, which was later identified as methaqualone. The consignment was booked by the exporter through a courier service in Chennai and sent to the Bengaluru hub for shipment to Kuala Lumpur. In the first week of January 2018, ketamine worth over Rs. 1 crore, hidden in sweet packages, was seized. That consignment, too, was marked for Kuala Lumpur, by an exporter in Chennai. “There are glaring similarities in the two cases. In both cases, the courier company is the same. The Customs Intelligence Unit of Bangalore Air Cargo is investigating the case,” an official said.",2018,4,1
19,"PCB mulls over legalizing match fixing, to offer it as service","Lahore, Pakistan. After realizing that its players just can’t stop themselves from fixing matches, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to accept the reality and turn it into a business model. From now onward, all matches involving Pakistan would be fixed by PCB under a scheme named “Cricket as a Service” or CaaS or Cricket-On-Demand, loosely modeled on SaaS (Software as a service).“We have tried everything from emotional appeals to legal actions hoping to fight match-fixing, but there doesn’t seem to be any success. Clearly, we were doing something wrong.” said PCB Chairman Ijaz Butt after an emergency round of meeting with his relatives, who incidentally are also important members of the board.Now even you can phone in PCB and get him overstepping any time you want“It’s ancient wisdom that if you can’t fight them, join them.” said Butt, justifying his decision to officially get into match-fixing. “Furthermore, there was always a risk that BCCI or ICC could legalize it before we do it.” he added, arguing that the step could bring in the much needed cash for the cash strapped board.As part of CaaS, an individual or organization would now have the option of dialing in an official representative of PCB for services like No-Ball-On-Demand, Wide-Ball-On-Demand, Wicket-On-Demand, Ball-Tampering-On-Demand, Injury-On-Demand, etc. An online bidding system would be in place and the service would be offered to the party offering largest amount for a particular event.“A wealthy fan, a rival cricket board, or any other interested party can avail of these services.” Butt informed, adding, “Such services would be cheaper than fixing the whole match as an interested party can try out with fixing a few balls or events to see how the match progresses.”“It thus retains the glorious uncertainties of the game as you never know who would fix the next ball.” he pointed out.“Anyone can participate; say a wealthy Sehwag fan can buy a No-Ball-On-Demand to deny a Sri Lankan batsman a century even though he might not have any interest in fixing the whole match.” Butt further elaborated upon the benefits of CaaS and how it could make cricket matches even more interesting.The PCB Chairman claimed that there was nothing illegal in such an arrangement and it was as innovative as IPL with a much higher earning potential, although he agreed that things would get complicated if and when other boards also starts offering Cricket-On-Demand, just as there is confusion over which player represents which team in Champions League T20.“We could have a situation where we have sold a No-Ball-On-Demand and the rival board had sold Wicket-On-Demand on the same ball. A middle way is that the batsman gets run-out, but I guess a clearing house for such conflicting demands will have to be set up by the ICC in future.” Butt said.Cricket lovers in Pakistan, who are hell irritated with recurring charges of match-fixing, had mixed reactions over the announcement, but many of them welcomed the decision.“I am happy. After giving the world first computer virus, it’s so nice that we are back to our innovative ways.” said Basit Alvi, a cricket lover and SaaS provider, who also offered to set up an online bidding platform for PCB to offer CaaS.(based on inputs by special correspondent Vinod Patil)",2010,8,0

23,Manmohan Singh Demands Resignation Of Ravi Shankar Prasad,"               New Delhi: In a shocking incident, India’s former PM Manmohan Singh finally broke his silence after over a decade, and immediately demanded resignation of Ravi Shankar Prasad for his alleged involvement in 4G scam. The event has sent India’s Telecom Minister in a state of extreme stress and depression.Mr. Ravi Shankar Prasad, upon hearing this new adventure by Dr. Manmohan Singh  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});“He was just sitting on his chair, sipping his morning tea, and reading newspaper just like any other day. Unable to find any mention of his name in newspapers, he started watching Rajya Sabha TV as usual. He misses a lot those good old days of glory,” said Gursharan Kaur, wife of Dr. Manmohan Singh.“I don’t know when, but somehow he read about Ravi Shankar Prasad being on payroll of Reliance. This is when I saw him fuming with a murderous rage and vengeance. His legs were shaking like crazy,” added Mrs. Kaur.“I was frightened. He raised his hands in the air and shouted like a voice from the sky- If Telecom Minister accepts my request to hear the voice of his conscience, the moment he lands in Delhi, he should head to the Rashtrapati Bhawan to tender his resignation. Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad, come on! Do you have any conscience left? Because the issue is not of Ravi Shankar Prasad, the issue is that of the integrity of the office of Telecom Minister of the country,” Mrs. Kaur described the scene of action.The news soon spread like wildfire in Lutyens’ zone, and reached residence of Ravi Shankar Prasad, who, according to an estimate, had himself demanded resignation of ex-PM Manmohan Singh 17,239 times during UPA-1 and UPA-2 combined. Shocked with this unexpected development, Mr. Prasad complained of ‘chest-pain‘, and was advised bed rest by his doctors afterwards.When Teekhi Mirchi inquired about his health over phone as a courtesy, he shot back demanding resignation of this reporter.Discussion comments",2014,12,0
24,BJP to provide memory booster pills to common man to remember scams by UPA,"New Delhi. Scared that the aam aadmi might forget the scams after the UPA government introduced decisions like reducing subsidy and allowing FDI in sectors like Retail and Aviation, BJP has decided to form an alternate strategy to defeat Congress.BJP will provide the common man with free memory boosting pills that would enable him to remember each and every scam by the UPA government, apart from helping him not forget other important issues like inflation and policy paralysis.The memory booster pills would be in all colors, especially in Saffron and Green, so that BJP gets support of secular NDA parties.“We tried stalling Parliament and it did create news, but unfortunately Parliament sessions don’t run round the clock like news channels,” LK Advani told Faking News, “Since we can’t bank on media companies, we have decided to rope in a pharma company to supply memory boosting tablets to the common man. They would help them those huge numbers reported by CAG and correctly map them to the respective scams.”The move has found the opposition divided as usual, with Nitish Kumar especially against any such attempt. Experts believe that Nitish Kumar is wary of people not forgetting his old pictures with Narendra Modi.Many other leaders, including some in BJP, have warned that such pills could prove to be counter-productive as people may not forget even promises made by politicians, such as promise to make a Ram Temple at Ayodhya, and later take them to task in the ensuing elections.However, Advani has assured that the special pills would only act as memory boosters and they would not make the common man any more intellectual, thus the control over the masses will retain with the politicians.While BJP is yet to distribute these free pills, Congress does not appear worried by the move.“We have good lawyers in our team to handle trivial issues like these. We will claim anything unfavorable to us as quoted out of context  by media. If we can’t convince them, we would  confuse them with our brilliant claims like Zero Loss theory,” claimed a Congress source.“And if even that doesn’t work, we will unleash Digvijay Singh on the common man,” the source revealed the strategy to counter BJP’s strategy.",2012,9,0

If he does not give me this raise, I will steal all of this office’s equipment one by one, starting with this stapler. If the management wants to stop this corruption, it better give me what I want’. God knows what got into him!”So did Python Nagaraju’s ultimatum work?“Nah!” said Perl Murugan. “His manager called Python into his office, and asked him to shut the f**k up. To add injury to insult, he allotted four priority issues to him and screwed his weekend!”Python’s Manager C Javamani said that calling Python’s bluff was a no-brainer. “If he really was the type to steal that stapler, he’d steal it anyway, regardless of how much he gets paid,” he shrugged, and added with a cheeky grin, “Come appraisal time next year, Python and everyone else in my team will get the salary hike they deserve – a full four hundred basis points.” A despondent Python now regrets his antics. “I should have known better than to trust AAP logic,” he said ruefully.In other news, Vijay Mallya has written to Arvind Kejriwal, asking for a ticket in the next assembly elections.",2015,12,0
26,DRDO unveils the world’s first secular robot – the Robo-Con,"In a stunning breakthrough of gargantuan proportions, DRDO has unveiled the world’s first secular robot. Powered by ‘dynamic secularisation’  technology, the robot, rather than blindly following the accepted definitions of secularism, adapts to the fast changing secular equations in India by parsing the secular utterances of leaders like L K Advani, Nitish Kumar, Jagdish Tytler, Mulayam Singh and Laloo and adjusting its definition of secularism on a real time basis.“True to its secular nature, the robot will always wear a tika, topi, kirpan and the cross at all times,” raved N Ram, principal scientist at the DRDO and chief engineer behind the technological marvel. N Ram, however, confessed that naming the robot was quite a challenge. After intense brainstorming at an exclusive resort for an entire week, the government came up with three equally compelling options: Rajiv, Indira and Nehru. A few PM loyalists suggested ‘Manmohan’ which was, though most befitting, quickly shouted down by Gandhi family loyalists. The deadlock was eventually broken after Rahul Gandhi pitched in to suggest Robo-Con. “I had this idea last night to draw Robo from Robot and Con from Congress,” said a straight faced Rahul, prompting a mini-stampede where congress leaders ran over each other to praise Rahul baba on his idea.Though the DRDO was initially apprehensive about building such a robot, they were convinced by many members looking for Governor posts of the strategic community about its importance in preserving the Idea of India. The Robo-Con was built in a record time of 5 months after Kapil Sibal decided to email one shayar every day to the scientists till the end of the project to boost their morale.Some of the features of Robo-Con are as follows:The Robo-Con is equipped with groundbreaking Labrador technology that can sniff and rate the ‘Secularity’ of a person.  This dynamic scale is based on the least and most secular persons at a point in time. Currently, it is set to rate Secularity on a scale of NarendraModi to LK Advani. This rating system will have a key role to play in the formation of coalitions after the 2014 general elections.The Robo-Con has a column generator app that can instantly create secular columns. After intense web crawling through endless columns, the Robo-Con has decided to write under the pen-name Bekaar Patel. Leading national daily newspapers led by ‘The UnHindu’ were learnt to have been extremely pleased with this app as their contributors were fast running out of new ideas to run-down communal leaders.(Readers can find some original ideas here). Depending on the size of the government scams exposed, it can generate columns that subtly take a dig at communal leaders or go on a vicious diatribe.The Robo-Con has a ‘NaMo NoMo’ app that can generate thousands of unique tweets appended with hash tags such as #BlowToModi #ModiFailure #Feku etc. This app has however caused consternation and insecurity among eNREGA liberal Tweeters, who had hitherto figured out a simple copy-paste approach to fulfilling their obligations to Sanjay Jha their conscience.The Robo-Con can also appear on TV debates with pre-loaded statements like “We do not need lessons from communal politicians”, “Tika bhi lagana hoga, topi bhi pehenni hogi”, “Secularism is in our pants, in our shirts”and of course “HAAAAAAAH-HAHAHAAH-WWOOOO-HOHOHO-BRRR-HAHAHA-KHIKHIKHIKHI”Another feather in Robo-Con’s hat is the face-recognition technology built-in to identify Osama Bin Laden, Hafiz Saeed look-alikes from the UID database to help some secular leaders in their attempt to woo the minority voters.However, scientists ran into a few stumbling blocks during the trials. While testing its face-recognition technology, Robo-Con apparently went bat-shit mental when confronted with the picture of Sanjay Jha, resulting in a massive operating system crash that took several hours to rectify. The other incident occurred when the Robot, while watching an episode of Face the Nation, suddenly fell head over heels in love with anchor Sagarika Ghose. “That was inexplicable, as we hadn’t programmed it to have any emotions. We haven’t been able to figure out why. We have spent several days trying to work it out, but the reason has eluded us so far,” said a frustrated scientist, between sips of Old Monk.Nevertheless, the Robo-Con has already been earmarked by the government to conduct workshops for the young and upcoming leaders/politicians who are struggling with the dynamic nature of Indian secularism. “This is a holistic game-changer that will train the leaders of future,” said I&amp;B Minister Manish Tewari. When approached for a comment, Dr. Shashi Tharoor observed: “This is a great innovation for a truly secular nation like ours. The sight few years ago of a Roman Catholic making way for a Sikh to be sworn in as PM by a Muslim…..” (well, you all know the drill by now)",2013,6,0
27,"Employee back to office after Diwali vacations works determinedly, sends Boss in shock","Mumbai: The festivity and liveliness exhibited by any Indian during Diwali automatically gets doubled when he gets few extra days off from work. And the same gets decimated to almost nil when he has to go back to work once the holidays are over.Boss shocked after seeing employee working diligently post Diwali vacationsBut reverse happened on Monday when Mr. Parth Kamchor, an IT employee, went to his office in a delighted mood and started working passionately, showing full zeal.This uncultured behavior of Mr. Parth was observed when other employees were sitting with dull and grief stricken faces on their desk, thinking why holidays got over at a quick speed and Parth was seen working with sheer concentration, with fully convinced that festival days are over now and one has to face the same heat of meeting the targets and deadlines as before.Mr. Rohit Chaploos, a colleague of Mr. Parth, gave us the description of what happened on Monday.“As it was Monday, morning blues were obvious. Also, people have returned from vacations, all of them had frown faces except one. We discovered that Parth was happy as he had received Diwali gifts from family and friends which he successfully handed over to other guests, playing parcel-parcel, keeping no inventory with him. This accomplishment made him proud of himself as he reduced his Diwali gifts costs to Nil this year, giving a cut-throat competition to Indian aunties,” said a little disappointed Rohit, who himself had to spent few bucks on gifts even after availing cashback from various e-commerce sites.Though Parth Kamchor’s passion for work was a positive sign for his team, it sent his manager Mr. Nirdaya Muafkar into a state of shock. It was unbelievable for him to see Parth showing such ambition for work, which he hadn’t shown anytime during the year, not even on the day of ratings. Mr Nirdaya was later on admitted to a far by hospital where he was given electric shocks to recover from the previous shock.When this thing was escalated to HR, she also almost went into depression seeing a happy employee in the company.Sources say that Parth has been approached by many companies to hold sessions on gifts rotation during festival seasons so that their employees work determinedly like him after coming back from festivals.",2015,11,0
28,Student studying for CA Final realises it’s Diwali after noise of firecrackers disturbs him,"Becoming a Chartered Accountant (CA) in India requires hard work and dedication, after the mandatory 20 years of life spent while trying to clear the exams. The journey of Abhijeet (39), a CA Final student in Delhi, is an example of the commitment one needs to become a chartered accountant. Abhijeet, who started CA at age 19, was so engrossed in studying that he did not realise that it’s Diwali, until the noise of firecrackers made him lose his focus.Abhijeet was in his study room when the noise of the firecrackers disturbed him, forcing him to come out of his room. His mother claims that Abhijeet has been relentlessly studying since six months. “We last saw him in May, when he went to the exam hall for his 28th attempt of the final exams. I am glad that the firecrackers disturbed him and he came out of his room. We will only see him again when he goes to the exam hall to fail in his next attempt,” said his mother.Abhijeet, who appeared unkempt due to several months of vigorous studying, spoke to us on his tour out of the study room. “I did not know about the arrival of Diwali. The noise caused due to firecrackers has wasted my entire five minutes. How will I clear my next attempt now?” said a worried Abhijeet, before he went back to his room to study. The Supreme Court, after banning the sale on firecrackers in Delhi-NCR, realised that the ban didn’t lead to an evident decrease in the pollution levels after BJP leaders distributed free firecrackers to poor kids who were in dire need of food and clothes. “Next Diwali, we will pass a law to ban bursting of firecrackers around houses of CA students who are yet to clear the exams. By doing so, a complete ban will be observed,” said a Supreme Court judge.",2017,10,0
29,Delhi HC sentences serial offender to rigorous punishment; made to book 50 Tatkal tickets on IRCTC,"In what is being termed as one of the harshest sentences in Indian judicial history, the Delhi High Court has ordered Mr. Arun Sharma, a serial offender convicted for damage to railway property, to book over 50 Tatkal tickets online through the IRCTC online passenger reservation system.Hon’ble Justice Kritpal Singh noted that though it was in excess of the punishment prescribed under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and appeared severe at first glance, it was justified in that it promoted specific and general deterrence. “While I feel bad for subjecting the defendant to such harsh punishment,  it is hoped that a railway passenger thinks twice before despoiling railway property, lest he or she be subjected to similar torture,” gravely observed Justice Singh.As soon as the judgment was announced, a shocked Mr. Sharma was heard screaming, ”nahin, please anything but this. What did I do to deserve this? Spare me this torture” as he was led away from the courtroom to undergo his sentence.The sentencing has sent shock-waves across the country. Taking suo moto notice of the issue, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has filed a review petition on behalf of the accused. “To punish someone by making him book railways tickets using the IRCTC server is inhumane and barbaric. There is no place for such forms of punishment in a civilized society. We have appealed to repeal the sentence since it is a direct infringement of the fundamental right to dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution,” said NHRC member, Shri Wajahat Habibullah.Promptly acting on the review petition, a special bench of the Delhi High Court has set aside the earlier judgment, much to the relief of the accused and his kin. “Such punishments must be meted out only in the rarest of rare cases, under exceptional circumstances. We have therefore decided, on humanitarian grounds, to annul the earlier order and direct the authorities to release Mr. Sharma forthwith from the excruciating torture of dealing with the IRTC server,” read the order.",2012,11,0
30,UPA’s economic miracle: Boosts GDP by 30% by valuing the work of the unpaid Indian housewife,"The UPA2 government today delivered spectacularly on the economic front by achieving a phenomenal GDP growth rate of 30%. It did so by the simple expedient of incorporating the value of unpaid domestic labour of the nation’s 60 crore women into the computation of India’s GDP.A chuffed up Prime Minister addressed the nation early this morning to break the news. “On 13th September 2012, moments before the clock struck midnight, India’s GDP grew by 30.6%. I am proud to say that India, from being one of the fastest growing countries in the world, is now THE fastest growing country in the world,” said Dr. Manmohan Singh, reading from a written speech, and flashed the V-sign at the camera for good measure.According to PMO insiders, the idea struck Dr. Singh on Thursday, when he was sipping evening tea at his residence, even as his better half, Mrs. Gurcharan Kaur let him know for the millionth time how under-appreciated she was for what she did. “If only I had taken up that bank job when I had the chance 30 years back, I wouldn’t be doing this thankless job of making aloo parathas for you,” she sighed wistfully, upon which Dr. Singh’s abruptly sprayed a mouthful of tea all over his newspaper. A moment later, he leapt up and rushed to call Deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia.“Monty yaar, simply by recognizing the opportunity cost of a woman taking up domestic duties instead of a regular job, as the value for unpaid labour, we can achieve massive growth and release some kickass animal spirits!” said an excited Dr. Singh. There was a pause on the other end after which Monty exclaimed, “Abe Sardar, this is mind blowing yaar!” The two eminent economists began jumping up and down in excitement on either end of the telephone line. Later, they got together to work on a spreadsheet and were up till 3 AM finalizing the exact GDP growth projections.The decision has been hailed by all parties barring BJP as an economic masterstroke. Many now believe that this might prove to be Dr. Singh’s second biggest contribution to the Indian economy after 1991 and may very well go on to define his legacy.“We have shown exactly how overrated good governance and a corruption free system is, when it comes to the economy. With some smart thinking and a bit of nifty excel work, we have got the economy roaring and left China far behind in terms of growth,” said Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram. When The UnReal Times asked the Minister if India would continue to retain its growth advantage, given that China could just as easily update its GDP definition, the Harvard educated lawyer replied triumphantly, “Aha! Thats where the genius of this plan lies. Research shows that Indian men are comparatively lazier than Chinese men, which means Indian women do a lot more thankless domestic work than their Chinese counterparts, and hence contribute a lot more to the GDP!”The UPA chairperson, Sonia Gandhi, welcomed the decision as well. “Frankly, I don’t understand all this GDP stuff, but it is good to know that I’ve been contributing greatly to the nation’s economy by mothering and pampering Rahul all this while, and I will continue to do so,” she said.The common man, meanwhile, is left rather perplexed about the turn of events. “I don’t understand,” said Sumathi, a mother of three from a middle-class household in Chennai. “Does this mean the government is going to pay us for what we do at home?”This UnReal Times correspondent had a hard time explaining to her that it was only a notional value attributed to her efforts as a daughter, sister, wife, mother, educator, accountant and so on, but his explanations rang hollow. After all how can one put a reasonable price on what a mother gives to her child?(Inspired by this WSJ piece by Rupa Subramanya)",2012,9,0

33,A tale of two Raja(t)s: the rise and fall of Rajat Gupta and  A Raja,"Both had humble, lower middle class origins, and mirrored each other in their rise. Through sheer perseverance and dedication… they scaled the summits of their chosen professions. Life was heady and glamorous at the top, but it also included dalliances with unsavory characters, and then suddenly, both experienced an Icarus like fall…. BUT THE SIMILARITIES END HERE. Rajat faces up to 25 years of imprisonment, while Raja, out on bail, received a hero’s welcome in Chennai and merely faces 25 years of intermittent court proceedings. Moral of the story: ",2012,6,0

35,US offers mediation in IND-PAK talks; India asks US to solve Cauvery issue first to prove capability,"Washington DC: The United States of America has offered mediation between India and Pakistan, to bring about peace in the subcontinent. India has declined the offer, citing the reason that any US mediation has historically brought more tension in the area, it is learnt by Faking News.Nikki Haley wondering how to resolve Cauvery dispute“We have declined the offer politely. The Trump administration has been insistent. So, finally we have given them a POC (Proof of concept) project to prove their mediation skills. If USA can solve the decades old dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka on Cauvery water, we will consider their proposal on India-Pakistan mediation. Both the state governments, the central government, and the honorable Supreme Court could not solve the issue for several years, Let’s see if Americans can succeed”, an external ministry official told Faking News.“Initially we proposed US mediation between natural allies BJP and Shiv Sena. US totally refused saying we shouldn’t give them impossible tasks. Then we proposed peace talks between Barkha Dutt and Arnab Goswami, US backed out again. We made yet another offer to neutralize the tension between AAP and LG, the USA threatened to break the ties with India. And finally, we offered Cauvery dispute”, he further explained the negotiations with the US.“If US passes in this test, achieving the impossible, the POC will be known not as Proof of Concept, but as Peace of Cauvery. Trump will be known as ‘Cauvery Appa’ in Tamil Nadu”, the external ministry official added.Meanwhile, Pakistan has asked US to mediate between Shahid Afridi fans and Misbah ul Haq fans.",2017,4,0
36,Government decides to quit chasing Vijay Mallya after he takes admission in JNU as PhD scholar,"The cat and mouse chase between the Indian government and the King of good times, Vijay Mallya came to an abrupt end when Mallya enrolled himself as a research student at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Mallya, who would be working on a research thesis on the topic ‘Financial Atrocities on Migrants in England’, has already got support from senior faculty members of JNU for a safe stay within the campus boundaries, until he finishes his PhD.“We have received requests from the police for arresting Vijay on charges of embezzlement of national wealth. I would like to remind the police that the concept of nation, nationalism and national wealth are all outdated terms of the Victorian era and need to be revised,” said a senior JNU professor, while withdrawing her salary from a nationalized bank’s ATM. “Also the police cannot enter the JNU campus without prior permission from the college administration. We have had enough. We have a strong history of blocking such undemocratic forces and we can very well repeat history.”Sources reveal that the government might let the investigation on the 9000 Crore scam wait until Mallya completes his doctorate and comes out of the campus. This is presumably, because authorities are a bit reluctant to take action after the mishandling of Kanhaiya Kumar’s case following which they were chased down and ridiculed by media persons everywhere.“I will also abscond if I am asked to arrest Mallya. We burnt our fingers badly last time, and I don’t want to get caught up in any JNU related matter again in the few days I have before retirement,” said Commissioner of Delhi Police, BS Bassi.Our correspondent, Kauva Hansal sneaked into the JNU campus looking for Mallya in a bid to interview him. After searching for him in the classrooms, labs and hostel rooms, he finally spotted him in the amphitheatre area, shaking his belly and sipping Kingfisher beer with his fellow students. When asked what he has to say about the charges, Mallya picked up a mike and cried, “Awaaaaaz do, Awaaaaaz do… Kingfisher tere tukde honge, Inshallah! Inshallah!… Mujhko chahiye azaadi, CBI se azaadi, SBI se azaadi, RBI se azaadi….[Give voice, give voice, Kingfisher, you’ll be broken to pieces, Inshallah, Inshallah, I want freedom, from CBI, from SBI, from RBI]” He continued sloganeering until our correspondent bowed down with folded hands and fled the campus.Mallya’s decision to join the PhD program has not only excited the professors at JNU, but also his chaddi-buddy, Lalit Modi. News has come in that the former IPL Kingpin would also be enrolling himself in the university’s Phd program, and live in the safe haven for the next 7 to 8 years, simultaneously running his business from the campus.However, Mallya’s honeymoon might end even before it starts, as several jobless Kingfisher employees too are reportedly planning to enrol themselves in JNU for various post-grad and doctorate courses. Like a few other JNU students, good grades are not on their agenda, but a kambhal-kutai [blanket-thrashing] of Mallya could possibly be.",2016,3,0
37,"Mulayam Singh Yadav lauds AAP leader, the Ashutosh, for assaulting English grammar","AAP leader, the Ashutosh, has found support from the unlikeliest quarters for the unlikeliest of reasons. SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has hailed the AAP leader as a true son of the soil for incessantly assaulting the rules of English grammar. Mulayam has been opposed to the primacy given to English and has sought that its usage be banned in Parliament.“Ashutosh, I am sorry, the Ashutosh, is India’s revenge on the British for 200 years of colonial rule,” an elated Mulayam said. “Tweets like this:Flying back to Delhi via Mumbai .. From rajkot … I could see a very strong undercurrent … People are fed with one man rule…— ashutosh (@ashutosh83B) January 27, 2014and this:Modi says Gujrat is developed. If developed then why Gujrat is in debt of 1.45 lakh crore ?— ashutosh (@ashutosh83B) January 26, 2014makes English speakers wince and wish that he communicates in Hindi instead.”The SP supremo said he will personally campaign for the Ashutosh so that he makes it to the Lok Sabha and delivers speeches in English. “I ensure that cow belt politicians only speak in Hindi on the Floor but for the Ashutosh I am willing to make an exception. I totally get what he is trying to do when he tweets like that,” he said.Hours after Mulayam’s glowing endorsement, the Ashutosh’s high school English teacher, Gyanesh Pande, apologized to his pupil. “I was always under the impression that the Ashutosh was just dumb when it came to internalizing grammar rules but only today I realized that it was part of a larger strategic design.”(We flouted our own editorial guidelines in a nod to the Ashutosh)",2014,2,0
38,"After rout on rank turner, Dhoni apologizes to Motera pitch curator, calls for lifeless pitches","With Team India done in by sharp spin bowling on a wickedly turning pitch in Mumbai, Dhoni has now profusely apologized to the curator of the Ahmedabad pitch, Dhiraj Parsana. MSD had earlier criticized Dhiraj for preparing a vapid, lifeless pitch on which the Indians struggled to win, and called for pitches that turned and bounced from day one.  Alas, the dumb Wankhede curator took Dhoni’s admonition at face value and prepared a rank turner, resulting in India’s rout.After making a quick dash for Ahmedabad, Dhoni had a tearful re-union with Dhiraj, beseeching him for forgiveness. A misty eyed Dhiraj in turn chided Dhoni for doubting his patriotism. “I am not a shrewd Gujju for nothing. After thoroughly analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the Indian team, I had concluded that lifeless pitches are the way to go in which the Indian batsmen can pile on  over 500 runs in quick time and then grind the opposition to dust for the rest of the match and meander to a dull win. I was surprised when Dhoni criticized me instead of praising me,” said a teary eyed Dhiraj as two hugged and made up.On the way back to Mumbai, Dhoni turned philosophical, contending that his boys felt so much at sea in the Mumbai Test that it seemed straight out of  the Hollywood flick, ‘Life of Pi’  and not just because he’s averaging 3.142 in the series. “Tossing and turning, with a few bunnies and a white elephant for company, and a ferocious tiger of a turning pitch to grapple with, that’s how surreal playing this Test was. I was one of the bunnies, of course,” noted the Indian skipper.“Or alternatively, the story of the match was that the English played and bowled spin better than we did. Which story you prefer depends on your belief in God and I’m not referring to SRT here,” he observed, as he lazily inhaled a cigarette and blew a circle in the air to sum up his own impact with the bat.Meanwhile, the groundsman for the 3rd Test to be played in Eden Gardens, Prasenjit Bose, has assured a jittery Indian camp that the pitch will be as lifeless as the dry bed of the Hughli in peak summer. “It will offer nothing for the bowlers and the Indians should easily pile up over 700 runs, with even SRT reaching double figures. After that the boys can press forth for a dull, meandering win,” he promised.",2012,11,0
39,"Students urge Smriti Irani to retain German, instead replace Maths with Sanskrit","New Delhi. HRD minister Smriti Irani’s decision to replace German with Sanskrit as third language in Kendriya Vidyalas seems to have not gone down well with many students and their parents.While they are fine with Sanskrit being introduced in curriculum, they are upset with it replacing German and claim such a decision could affect their overall percentages and grades.Smriti thinking over it.These students along with their parents are therefore urging Smriti to reconsider her decision and instead replace Mathematics, History or similar tough subjects with Sanskrit.“German was the only subject whose paper my son would look forward to. In fact from an embarrassing 60s, his percentage would soar to respectable 70s thanks to the European language,” a parent explained how German has been a boon to parents like him, when it comes to facing anxious relatives after announcement of results.“And I am not saying that Sanskrit doesn’t fetch you marks, but it is a pointless exercise with end benefit zero if you are replacing it with an already high scoring German,” the parent added.Parents further feel that the debate over third language in schools is needless and the time is right to have a concept of fourth language in schools.“Let’s have German and Sanskrit both and maybe even French, even if it has to be at expense of Mathematics or Science. It’s painful to see my daughter always being few marks short of Singhal sahab’s daughter next door,” another parent argued.“Well if you are saying that German and Sanskrit is not useful in long run, tell me one instance where algebraic concepts have come to your rescue in your career,” another parent shot back when asked how these languages could benefit the child more than Mathematics in long run.Meanwhile Jihadist group ISIS has asked Smriti Irani to forget both Sanskrit and German and instead introduce Arabic in schools as they are soon going to rule the entire world including India.",2014,11,0
